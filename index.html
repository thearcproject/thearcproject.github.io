Hello World. Welcome to my github pages.
Envisioned back in Cymru, UK in 2010, [b]theARCproject[/b] is currently based at the "gateway to the Alpujarras" in Spain.

I currently reside on a mountain being all techie & permaculturey with my cat!

In October 2017, I turned 42 ~ & I decided to:
1. Stop Looking for the Answer! {as Douglas Adams' mice put it: "no-one asked the question")
2. To decentralise my life. {in reality & virtuality}
3. To share more and freer. 

This page is a way of doing that!
